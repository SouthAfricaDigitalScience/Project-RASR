# Introduction

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an important part of modern daily life, present in nearly all parts of communication technology. However, resources are biased towards certain languages, whilst indigenous and local languages are under-resourced. There is nonetheless a large and active research community dedicated to developing speech recognition. Workflows have bee developed in order to provide research communities with a means to improve collaboration and synergy across the field.

# Problem Statement

The lack of synergy and collaboration in HLT ASR development in SA coupled with underutilization of available High Perfomance Computing (HPC) resources and initiatives such as SA National Grid has driven this study to explore the development of a web-based system that fully utilizes high perfomance computing whilst promoting synergy and collaboration in ASR research.  

# Background

ASR is technology that allows a computer to identify the words that a person speaks into a microphone or telephone and convert it to written text.

# Proposed solution

Web based ASR System that utilizes available high performance computing resources as well as other technologies such as Open Access Repository (OAR), gLibrary,  Continuous Delivery of Research Applications in Distributed Environment (CODE-RADE) and Keepler workflow management system.
