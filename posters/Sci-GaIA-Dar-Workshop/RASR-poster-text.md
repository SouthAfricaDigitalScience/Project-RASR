# Introduction

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an important part of modern daily life, present in nearly all parts of communication technology. However, resources are biased towards certain languages, whilst indigenous and local languages are under-resourced. There is nonetheless a large and active research community dedicated to developing speech recognition. Workflows have been developed in order to provide research communities with a means to improve collaboration and synergy across the field.

# Automated Speech Recognition

ASR is technology that allows a computer to identify the words that a person speaks into a microphone or telephone and convert it to written text. However, these methods are dependent on several parameters and filters, which are selected heuristically and independently by various groups. Although consistent corpi exist for various indigenous languages, the methodology for generating speech models, training data, etc are not easily shared, and can be difficult to reproduce.

Furthermore, ASR is a highly computationally-intensive machine-learning task, and requries significant amounts of processing and data resources. Although these exist

# Problem Statement

The lack of synergy and collaboration in HLT ASR development in SA coupled with underutilization of available High Perfomance Computing (HPC) resources and initiatives such as SA National Grid has driven this study to explore the development of a web-based system that fully utilizes high perfomance computing whilst promoting synergy and collaboration in ASR research.  

# Background

ASR is technology that allows a computer to identify the words that a person speaks into a microphone or telephone and convert it to written text.

# Sci-GaIA contribution

Sci-GaIA promotes and supports a platform for Open Science which provides several of the tools and services necessary. The Summer Hackfest started work on a web-based ASR System focussing on re-utilisation on reproducibility of speech recognition: RASR. RASR combines compute resources, Open Access data repositories, metadata libraries, and peristence and uniqueness frameworks to allow researchers to discover, extend and reproduce ASR work.
