# Introduction

Reproducible Automatic Speech Recognitions (RASR) workflows is a use case developed so as to provide the rich South African Human Language Technology (HLT)Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) development research community with open source data storage and training resources on the web so as to enhance research in this focus area as well as promote synergy in research in this field.

# Problem Statement

The lack of synergy and collaboration in HLT ASR development in SA coupled with underutilization of available High Perfomance Computing (HPC) resources and initiatives such as SA National Grid has driven this study to explore the development of a web-based system that fully utilizes high perfomance computing whilst promoting synergy and collaboration in ASR research.  

# Background

ASR is technology that allows a computer to identify the words that a person speaks into a microphone or telephone and convert it to written text.

# Proposed solution

Web based ASR System that utilizes available high performance computing resources as well as other technologies such as Open Access Repository (OAR), gLibrary,  Continuous Delivery of Research Applications in Distributed Environment (CODE-RADE) and Keepler workflow management system.
